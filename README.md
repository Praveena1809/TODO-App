TODO app

This is a simple To Do Application in react. In this application, I've used React components, React forms, event handlers etc. It is a very easy quick application to do.

Commands used to install Font awesome:

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
